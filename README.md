## Some collagist? Not just any one though...

Hey, I'm Johann .-.<br>
I've been writing software since 2017 in a variety of languages and over a variety of things. My main interests are in language development, automated bots for social media (especially discord), and just basic tools to make the hard stuff a little easier.
I'm always looking for a decent challenge - nothing too adventurous but never anything too easy. If you've got anything you'd like to collaborate on with me, just contact me by some of the following:
